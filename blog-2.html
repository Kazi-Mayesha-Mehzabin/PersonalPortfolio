            <b>Tea: A Companion</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">Tea has been named after an emotion, perhaps</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">Why are we drawn towards it so much?</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px;">Tea should not be drunk in hurry. Not because you are getting
            late for your office. Not because you might miss your train and not under pressure. </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px;">I need time. I need space, a fresh mind a feeling of tranquility.
            I need space for my thoughts to keep hovering me with questions as I take every sip of tea. I need peace to
            relish every reek of my tea. Time goes by, and my tea gets a little warm. But it is okay. Its okay to give
            time to things you love. Because , while I have a cup full of tea on the palm of my hands, I feel like I
            have all the time in the world. I think I have gone after the men of my family on drinking tea. Because the
            women drink tea like as if their train is leaving. Because they love it all hot boiling and the men, they
            are more calm and patient while drinking tea. I can not really blame that on the women because they take
            care of everything. If any women of my family ever see this all she will say is “Men do not have to do all
            the chores”. I would never deny that. You women are incredible. .</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">I prefer my tea with time. So that I could think of something
            strange or impeccably weird. Or I could rummage through the Netflix or maybe watch an episode of one of my
            favorite series or maybe just have a nice little chat with someone I love. Its okay to give yourself some
            time.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">At least give yourself some moments of peace to savor the little
            time we have left.</p>
