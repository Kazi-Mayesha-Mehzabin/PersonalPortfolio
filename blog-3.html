            <b>River of People</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">People have a way of asking questions. They exactly know what to
            ask and apparently, they all ask the same question.
            Why are you sad?
            Human hardly knows what exactly is going on in their mind. When it comes to expressing, humans are cryptic.
            Though they cannot be blamed for that. You barely know what might trigger in people if they hear your side
            of the story. Your thoughts could scare them off or maybe they could be a glimpse of tranquility to your
            aching heart. We are being consumed by our own thoughts.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px;">Nothing in the long run is acceptable. Specially if you are not
            the person who everyone thought you were.We do not see everything coming, be it good or extremely bad. When
            you convince yourself to see good in everything, to accept people in the way they are, you give them a
            position of authority. How long are you going to hold on to that thought? Does it suffice to say I will be
            there for you? The question is for how long? What is the duration? but what exactly is the answer? Do we
            know the answer? Are we strong enough to face the answer? </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px;">TEven in the river of people we are still alone. After days of
            spending time with people you are so confident about you get this one sudden feeling, “Is this forever?”.
            No, nothing is forever, but we should not let go of the little happiness we are getting out of that.
            Happiness is a choice which no human should ever cease to make. We choose people we want to be with, perhaps
            we even lie to ourselves to eradicate the intuition the conscience which repeatedly tell us to think over
            that decision again. You can be with the people you admire so wholeheartedly; you can spend years of vivid
            moments. You let people in, you let them in in your secrets that you spend every bit of your life protecting
            with the hope to never have that faith shattered. At the end of the day, you are all by yourself. People
            cannot guarantee your happiness, your peace and most importantly “Yourself”. Every decision we take includes
            a person. A person we trust a person we know or maybe a person we want to trust. we humans are vulnerable
            when it comes to emotions. Not like we are born with vulnerability but it is because we choose to be
            vulnerable. We let our emotions get the best of us.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">Sometimes we are just one step away from the light yet so close
            to the darkness.
            Moment Passes by and the memories start to fade memories of the loved ones. When these memories haunt you,
            we think so many things at once but as the time passes, we become so cold that even the worst news you
            cannot hurt us. Remember, cannot love cannot hurt? Is it that the human emotions are so fragile or is it
            just that we are strong enough to face the fear?

            You feel like you are under a big ocean where you find it impossible to breathe right? It is because you
            never learned to swim. Beneath the ocean take a deep breath not like it's the water but the happiness you
            have been holding yourself from. Life or ocean, you can always make it to the surface with or without
            anyone.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">Thoughts are very subjective. Maybe the reason for us being
            different. Perhaps, that is why we get along so well.
