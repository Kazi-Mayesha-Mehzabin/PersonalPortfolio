        <p>We are unaware of so many things, yet we live our lives pretending to be omniscient. An individual
            perspective in this world where everyone seems to have a clear idea about you is uncanny. No human should
            ever kneel to another person's desire. Despite all the odds of life, there lies a feeling of tranquility in
            being true to yourself. Facing the truth takes courage and not everyone is courageous, but people will not
            do that. You know why? Because it would then make their life easier.</p>
