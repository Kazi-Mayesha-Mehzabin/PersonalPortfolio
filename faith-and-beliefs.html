            <b>Faith and Beliefs</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">We are unaware of so many things, yet we live our lives pretending to be
            omniscient. An individual
            perspective in this world where everyone seems to have a clear idea about you is uncanny. No human should
            ever kneel to another person's desire. Despite all the odds of life, there lies a feeling of tranquility in
            being true to yourself. Facing the truth takes courage and not everyone is courageous, but people will not
            do that. You know why? Because it would then make their life easier.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px;">We are often jeopardized by our past experiences, past decisions and lessons. The
            lessons we learn from the
            past isn’t always as explicit as we think it is and it barely changes anything rather it pushes us to the
            verge of our existence where being alive is just a relief to the other but to us, we are no less than a
            walking corpse. When we grow, we have these so many dreams brewing up inside of us. We dream of
            accomplishing the uneven, outrunning the inevitable, but in this period of time, we come across so many
            realities that it gets abundantly hard to get past the insecurities that we grow. By the time we outweigh
            the obstacles, these big dreams keep getting smaller and smaller. The only existential agony stays with you
            is that,you could never understand the world you tried to believe in. What did you believe?</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px;">The greatest irony in the history of human kind is people will tell you to accept
            realities which they think is tolerable, which they think is worthy of believing.
            They think they are protecting us from human formed apocalypse. Whereas in
            reality, they are just imposing their incapability’s on us in the name of
            patronizing. Even nature fights back when things go out of order, where humans
            are incapacitated and expected to enjoy the inferiority of their circumstances. I
            would say there is nothing unpleasant in defying the conventions and breaking
            down the obnoxiousness of a society. We have so many true stories hovering 
            around us though, little do we know about the truth that the beholder holds.</p>
